Adding user accounts is described at 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/adding-users.html

Connecting to the MySQL server remotely is explained at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/connecting.html

Creation of read-only account:

mysql> create user 'scoophealth'@'endpoint.theirdomain' IDENTIFIED BY 'our_assigned_password'

mysql> grant select on OSCAR12.* to 'scoophealth'@'endpoint.theirdomain';

mysql> show grants for 'scoophealth'@'localhost';
mysql> show grants for 'scoophealth'@'%';

Removal of account:

mysql> drop user 'scoophealth'@'localhost';
mysql> drop user 'scoophealth'@'%';

By default, mysqld will only bind to 127.0.0.1 on Ubuntu server.  To enable
remote address comment out the line "bind-address = 127.0.0.1".

A typical Java JDBC connection configuration for the EMR Oscar 12
would look something like this:
---------------
# mysql database name
db_name = oscar_12_1

# username
db_username = userx

# password for the username above
db_password=passwd4userx

db_type = mysql
db_driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
db_uri = jdbc:mysql://db-host.domain-name:3306/
