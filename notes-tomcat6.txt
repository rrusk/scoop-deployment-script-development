Since the Oscar properties file is kept in an encrypted filesystem, tomcat6
must be started manually after the filesystem is unlocked.

To stop tomcat6 from starting on system boot, make sure that these startup
files are removed (but leave the shutdown files):

/etc/rc2.d/S92tomcat6
/etc/rc3.d/S92tomcat6
/etc/rc4.d/S92tomcat6
/etc/rc5.d/S92tomcat6

Remove them using: sudo rm /etc/rc?.d/S92tomcat6
